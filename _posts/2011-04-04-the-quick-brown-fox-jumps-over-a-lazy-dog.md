In a school project, my team and I created a website with Japanese Woodblock Art as our promopt. I was the mapping specialist and was also responsible for cleaning the data with the skills and knowledge that I have. The dataset given was incomplete, therefore, I cleaned the data by replacing empty string in the NA values, identify duplicates in the dataset, and fix any error the dataset may present. 

As the mapping specialist, I created a mapping data visualization that shows the birth places of artists who produced Japanese woodblock art. It can fit in with our narrative because we can analyze how the art differs by region - perhaps focusing on specific Japanese prefectures. For the data visualization process, we were able to plot the birth places on the map, with more birth places per location correlating to a larger bubble. However, in some cases, when we hover over the bubbles, the labels differ slightly even though they represent the same location. For example, when we hover over Tokyo, there are multiple Tokyo-analogous labels that could just be condensed to “Tokyo.”

We also wanted to narrow down our topic.

The graph above provides insights into the temporal distribution of woodblock artwork in the museum collection. The fact that the year 1850 has the most count of woodblock artwork suggests that this was a particularly prolific period for woodblock artists, and reflects historical and cultural factors that led to increased production during this time. Similarly, the high count of woodblock artwork from 1895 may reflect the popularity of woodblock prints during the late 19th century, when Japan was undergoing rapid modernization and cultural exchange with the West.

The website contains research on the history of Japanese woodblock art, its tradition, western influence, and consumerism.
