## Analyzing Efficiency Across Social Media Platforms

This project was conducted in Python using data from EvilGeniuses of different social media platforms. I analyzed the dataset in order to explore efficiency in engagement rate across different social media platforms. 

By conducting this analysis, we hope to answer how can EvilGeniuses' social media plotforms perform better whilst retaining the engagement of users.

The above is the plotted mean engagement rate by hour of day. Based on the analysis, the prime hour that produces the highest mean engagement rate by hour of day is at 8am which makes a lot of sense as that is the time in which most working adults and students wake up and tend to scroll on their phone in the morning. The second rise in the graph is at 1pm, which corresponds to lunch time. The final rise is at 7pm, and this is when most working professioinals get back home from work, which explains the rise in engagement rate.

Next, this graph is the plot grouped by day of week and hour to find the average engagement rate. It appears that Friday at 3am has the highest engagement rate. However, the time in which showcase the highest engagement rate by hour and day of the week did not make a lot of sense. After taking a deeper analysis on the data, I found that there is only 1 single data point in the hour on Friday with a high engagement rate. With the lack of sample in the combination for Friday, the graph proves to be an inaccurate representative.

## Findings

Among other findings with the dataset, I defined a posting strategy for EvilGeniuses and their social channels. Based on my disvoceries, I recommended social channels focus posting mixed media type as it retains the most engagement rate. I would also suggest Tuesdays and Thursdays to be the prime days of posting as it has the highest mean engagement rate by day of week, with the best time to post at 8 in the morning.
