# About Me

Hello! My name is Rachael Lim. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Statistics and Data Science with a minor in Digital Humanities at the University of California, Los Angeles. I chose to pursue this major because I enjoy problem-solving, being sure of things, and making data-driven decisions is my way of doing that. I am open to roles as a Data Analyst and Data Scientist. My experiences with data mostly focus on organizing data or making strategic recommendations -- feel free to read the posts to learn more about my experiences!

A little about my background is that I was born and raised in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and moved to the States for high school to further my education. The picture provided above and on the home page is the city I grew up in! I feel extremely blessed to have the opportunity to be exposed to two completely different cultures as it contributes to my versatile perspective.


I know a lot can change in the next few years of my life, but I truly enjoy learning and hope to never stop seeking new learning opportunities.

> ##### You miss 100% of the shots you don't take

This is one of my favorite quotes. I look at the abundance of opportunities available for me in UCLA, academia, and extracurricular activities... and I told myself that I should at least give them a shot -- even if I feel unqualified, even if I doubt myself, even if everyone else seems to be much better at it than me.

I transferred to UCLA after the COVID-19 pandemic settled down. Therefore, when I first transferred to UCLA, I felt underqualified and overwhelmed by the missed opportunities. However, fueled by perseverance, persistence, and determination to thrive in my chosen field, I engaged in a series of impactful experiences. I took up online courses in SQL, Python, and machine learning in my free time to improve my skillset, participated in and won a Hackathon, and completed a research project. 

Fast forward 1 year later, with the technical skills that I have obtained through coursework and self-learning, I established my first online business and transformed this setback into an opportunity for self-growth. I also scored an internship at a private banking firm as a data analyst intern and held 2 leadership roles on campus. I'm so glad I took these shots!

I hope this website can give you a glimpse of my life as well as my passion for my future career!

Happy Binge Read(ing) ~
