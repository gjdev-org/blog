# About

I am a passionate Data Analyst and aspiring Data Scientist with experience in programming in R and Python, and skills and knowledge in data and statistical analysis. For the past year, I have developed my skills in Data Analysis and Data Science by taking online Python courses as well as relevant courses in school that can better my abilities in the chosen fields. I am also part of the Data Science club in school that conducts research and build predictive models in R or Python in various fields ranging from financial to journal articles. I am eager to learn and will be putting my best foot forward in anything that I do.
